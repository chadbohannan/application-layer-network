Sample Usage: [blinky-aln](https://github.com/chadbohannan/blinky-aln)

As of this writing (Sept 2022) the blinky-aln android app is a prototype of the ALN-Wrench application and is thus not yet deployed to Google Play.

At some point in the future the blinky-aln repo will be abandoned and ALN-Wrench-Android will either be moved into this repo or a new repo of its own.
