Sample Usage: [blinky-aln](https://github.com/chadbohannan/blinky-aln)

As of this writing (Sept 2022) the blinky-aln android app is a prototype of the ALN-Wrench application and is thus not yet deployed to Google Play.

Following release to Play the blinky-aln repo will be deprecated in favor of a repository containing just the android application.
